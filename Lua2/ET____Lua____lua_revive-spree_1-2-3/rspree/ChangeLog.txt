1.2.3
- play sounds just for the clients who have messages enabled
 ... and only for them, not just at their location ;-)

1.2.2
- just count to sv_maxclients - 1

1.2.1
- small speedup on sayClients()

1.2.0
- per client setting if they want the rspree messages

1.1.12
- fixed typo which prevented Monster revives from being saved to awards.txt

1.1.11
- removed the 'sets' URL, some servers get problems with too long 'sets'

1.1.10

  record
- if srv_record is false... don't write the file

1.1.9
- fixed another missing space
- color fixes
- new: allow_tk_revive -- see docs, it's not really that what you think 
  it is ;)

1.1.8
- awards for monster revives saved to "awards.txt" ... same as kspree.lua :)
- fixed typo in changed message from 1.1.7

1.1.7
- bugfixing
- untested: only if non zero, the !stats parts should be printed now (i.e. no
  message about multi revives if the calling player didn't make any, just the
  number of revives)

1.1.6
- major speedup reading files, thanks to bennz (now finally split() 
  is gone :))

1.1.5
- bugfix for new players :(

1.1.4
- small speedup
- fix sometimes working !rsprees

1.1.3
- use all "local" vars
- just one saving function for both files
- minor enhacements (killer <= sv_maxplayers) instead of ~= 1022 or ~= 1023

1.1.2
- "!stats" ... to see your own multi / monster / normal revive stats
- reformatted "!rsprees" message
- expiring (and first seen) of the records

1.1.1
- err.. fixed uninitialized table

1.1.0
- renamed 1.02 to 1.1.0 to indicate a new dev cycle ;->

1.02
- "!rsprees" command which shows the players with the most Monster-Revives, 
   Multirevives and normal revives
- "rspreerecords" console command .. same output as above, just on console

1.01
- some cosmetical changes in some messages
- splitted the "This is a new map record!" ingame message into a new line
- released to public

1.0 
- some cosmetical changes in end of spree messages
- reformatted '!spree_record' to match the output of etadmin_mod (i.e.
  alltime stats for map / global)

0.12
- cosmetical changes on spree msgs (removed extra space after number
  of revives) 
- "endofmap" @ "Timelimit"/"Wolf EndRound", stats then printed @ "WeaponStats:"
- new: client say "!spree_record" (cmd configurable in 'rspree_cmd') 
  which prints current reviving spree record (this needs testing)

0.11
- rewritten alltime_stats handling, see "Notes" below about how the 
  table now is done
  this affects the date/time of the spree: now when the medic dies 
  instead of the end of the map..
  ...oh, and names in spree_cfg are coloured now .)
- err ... finally moved the medic detection to et_Print() ;-)
  hopefully this fixes the case that some sprees are not detected...

0.10
- if client with max_spree disconnects max_spree is resetted... else 
  the next player on this slot will get the reward 
- on death of medic: check if it's a new map record and print it

 "Longest reviving spree" msg later than before)
- sets commands for server mods :o)
- different positions for multi/monster now configurable
- new console command "rsprees" ... dumps all current reviving sprees
- new console command "rspreesall" ... dumps alltime stats
- + bugfixing

  ("sound/misc/multirevive.wav" and "sound/misc/monsterrevive.wav")

0.7

0.6
- alltime spree ... saved @ EOL, loaded @ start
 ... loading works, save needs testing
